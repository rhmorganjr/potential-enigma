# Automatically Generate Project's README by Russell Morgan

  ## Description
  This week's challenge was to create a javascript module to automatically generate the project's README.md file. It uses input from the user, as answers to prompts for the data. Besides javascript, the file system (fs) was used to write out the README and inquirer was used to prompt the questions to the user.
